Fig. 1. We propose a method for fast forward and inverse ray tracing of particle-based scene representations such as Gaussians. The main idea is to construct
encapsulating primitives around each particle, and insert them into a BVH to be rendered by a ray tracer specially adapted to the high density of overlapping
particles. Efficient ray tracing opens the door to many advanced techniques, including secondary ray effects like mirrors, refractions and shadows, as well as
highly-distorted cameras with rolling shutter effects and even stochastic sampling of rays. Project page: GaussianTracer.github.io

Particle-based representations of radiance fields such as 3D Gaussian Splat-
ting have found great success for reconstructing and re-rendering of complex
scenes. Most existing methods render particles via rasterization, projecting
them to screen space tiles for processing in a sorted order. This work instead
considers ray tracing the particles, building a bounding volume hierarchy
and casting a ray for each pixel using high-performance GPU ray tracing
hardware. To efficiently handle large numbers of semi-transparent particles,
we describe a specialized rendering algorithm which encapsulates parti-
cles with bounding meshes to leverage fast ray-triangle intersections, and
shades batches of intersections in depth-order. The benefits of ray tracing

rasterization. Experiments demonstrate the speed and accuracy of our ap-

INTRODUCTION

1
Multiview 3D reconstruction and novel-view synthesis are a classic
challenge in visual computing, key to applications across robotics,
telepresence, AR/VR, and beyond. Many approaches have been
proposed, but most recently particle-based representations have
shown incredible success, ignited by 3D Gaussian Splatting [Kerbl
et al. 2023] (3DGS)‚Äîthe basic idea is to represent a scene as a large
unstructured collection of fuzzy particles which can be differentiably
rendered by splatting to a camera view with a tile-based rasterizer.
The location, shape, and appearance of the particles are optimized
using a re-rendering loss.

Meanwhile, more broadly in computer graphics, rendering has
long been a duality between rasterization and ray tracing. Tradition-
ally, rasterization supported real-time performance at the expense
of approximating image formation, while ray tracing enabled fully
general high-fidelity rendering in the expensive offline setting. How-
ever, the introduction of specialized GPU ray tracing hardware and
real-time renderers has moved ray tracing into the realm of real-time
performance.

This work is motivated by the observation that 3DGS is limited
by the classic tradeoffs of rasterization. The tile-based rasterizer is
ill-suited to rendering from highly-distorted cameras with rolling
shutter effects, which are important in robotics and simulation. It
also cannot efficiently simulate secondary rays needed to handle
phenomena like reflection, refraction, and shadows. Likewise, ras-
terization cannot sample rays stochastically, a common practice for
training in computer vision. Indeed, prior work has already encoun-
tered the need for these capabilities, but was limited to rendering
with restrictive tricks or workarounds [Niemeyer et al. 2024; Seiskari
et al. 2024]. We instead aim to address these limitations by making
the ray traced Gaussian particles efficient, with a tailored imple-
mentation for specialized GPU ray tracing. To be clear, goal of this
work is not to offer an end-to-end solution to unsolved problems
like global illumination or inverse lighting on particle scenes, but
rather to provide a key algorithmic ingredient to future research on
these problems: a fast differentiable ray tracer.

Efficiently ray tracing Gaussian scenes (and more generally semi-
transparent surfaces) is not a solved problem [‚ÄúTanki‚Äù Zhang 2021].
We find that even past algorithms that were specially designed for
ray tracing semi-transparent particles [Br√ºll and Grosch 2020; Knoll
et al. 2019; M√ºnstermann et al. 2018] are ineffective on these scene
reconstructions, due to the huge numbers of non-uniformly dis-
tributed and densely-overlapping particles. Accordingly, we design
a customized GPU-accelerated ray tracer for Gaussian particles with
a ùëò-buffer [Bavoil et al. 2007] hits-based marching to gather ordered
intersections, bounding mesh proxies to leverage fast ray-triangle
intersections, and a backward pass to enable optimization. Each
of these components is carefully tested for speed and quality on a
variety of benchmarks. We found it crucial to tune the details of
the algorithm to the task at hand. Our final proposed algorithm
is almost 25x faster than our first naive implementation, due to a
wide range of algorithmic and numerical factors. We hope that these
learnings will be of value to the community leveraging raytracing
on particle representations.

The fundamental approach of representing a scene with parti-
cles is not limited to the Gaussian kernel; and recent work has
already shown several natural generalizations [Huang et al. 2024].
Our ray tracing scheme, as well as the benefits and applications
above, likewise generalizes more broadly to particle-based scene
representations, as we show in section Section 4.5.

We evaluate this approach on a wide variety of benchmarks and
applications. On standard multiview benchmarks, ray tracing nearly
matches or exceeds the quality of the 3DGS rasterizer of Kerbl et al.
[2023], while still achieving real-time rendering framerates. More
importantly, we demonstrate a variety of new techniques made
easy and efficient by ray tracing, including secondary ray effects
like shadows and reflections, rendering from cameras with high
distortion and rolling shutter, training with stochastically sampled
rays and more.

In summary, the contributions of this work are:

‚Ä¢ A GPU-accelerated ray tracing algorithm for semi-transparent

particles.

‚Ä¢ An improved optimization pipeline for ray-traced, particle-

based radiance fields.

‚Ä¢ Generalized Gaussian particle formulations that reduce the
number of intersections and lead to improved rendering effi-
ciency.

‚Ä¢ Applications demonstrating the utility of ray tracing, includ-
ing: depth of field, shadows, mirrors, highly-distorted cameras,
rolling shutter, incoherent rays, and instancing.

2 RELATED WORK
2.1 Novel-View Synthesis and Neural Radiance Fields
Classical approaches to novel-view synthesis can be roughly cat-
egorized based on the sparsity of the input views. In the case of
sparse views, most methods first construct a proxy geometry us-
ing multi-view stereo [Sch√∂nberger and Frahm 2016; Sch√∂nberger
et al. 2016] and point cloud reconstruction methods [Kazhdan et al.
2006; Kazhdan and Hoppe 2013] and then unproject the images
onto this geometry either directly in terms of RGB colors [Buehler
et al. 2001; Debevec et al. 1996; Wood et al. 2000] or extracted la-
tent features [Riegler and Koltun 2020, 2021]. The novel views are
rendered by projecting the color or features from the geometry to
the camera plane. In the case of densely sampled input views, the
novel-view synthesis can instead be formulated directly as light
field interpolation problem [Davis et al. 2012; Gortler et al. 1996;
Levoy and Hanrahan 1996].

Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) [Mildenhall et al. 2020] have
revolutionized the field of novel-view synthesis by representing
the scenes in terms of a volumetric radiance field encoded in a
coordinate-based neural network. This network can be queried at
any location to return the volumetric density and view-dependent
color. The photo-realistic quality of NeRFs has made them the stan-
dard representation for novel-view synthesis. Follow-up works have
focused on improving the speed [M√ºller et al. 2022; Reiser et al.
2021], quality [Barron et al. 2021, 2022, 2023], and surface represen-
tation [Li et al. 2023; Wang et al. 2021, 2023a; Yariv et al. 2021]. NeRF
has also been extended to large-scale scenes [Li et al. 2024a; Turki

et al. 2022], sparse inputs views [Niemeyer et al. 2022], in-the-wild
image collections [Martin-Brualla et al. 2021], and reflections [Guo
et al. 2022]. Finally, several works investigated ways to speed up
the inference by baking the neural fields to more performant rep-
resentations [Duckworth et al. 2023; Reiser et al. 2024, 2023; Wang
et al. 2023b]. While achieving high quality and fast rendering speeds,
these methods often employ compute-expensive multi-stage train-
ing procedures.

2.2 Point-Based and Particle Rasterization
Grossman and Dally [1998] defined point-based rendering as a sim-
ple rasterization of object surface points along with their color and
normals. However, due to the infinitesimal size of the points, such
simple rasterization inevitably led to holes and aliasing. To address
these limitations, later work converted points to particles with a
spatial extent, such as surfels, circular discs, or ellipsoids [Pfister
et al. 2000; Ren et al. 2002; Zwicker et al. 2001]. More recently, points
or particles have also been augmented with neural features and ren-
dered using rasterization in combination with CNN networks [Aliev
et al. 2020; Kopanas et al. 2021; R√ºckert et al. 2022] or NeRF-like
volumetric rendering [Ost et al. 2022; Xu et al. 2022].

Differentiable rendering through alpha blending was also ex-
tended to volumetric particles. Pulsar [Lassner and Zollh√∂fer 2021]
proposed an efficient sphere-based differentiable rasterization ap-
proach, which allows for real-time optimization of scenes with
millions of particles. The seminal 3DGS work of Kerbl et al. [2023]
instead represented the scenes using fuzzy, anisotropic 3D Gaussian
particles. By optimizing the shape, position, and appearance of these
Gaussian particles through an efficient tile-based rasterizer, 3DGS
achieves SoTA results in terms of perceptual quality and efficiency.
3DGS inspired many follow-up works that aim to reduce the render
time or memory footprint [Fan et al. 2023; Niedermayr et al. 2023;
Papantonakis et al. 2024], improve surface representation [Gu√©-
don and Lepetit 2023; Huang et al. 2024], and support large-scale
scenes [Kerbl et al. 2024; Ren et al. 2024], and more.

Jointly, these works have made significant progress, but they still
inherit limitations of rasterization. Indeed, they are not able to rep-
resent highly distorted cameras, model secondary lighting effects,
or simulate sensor properties such as rolling shutter or motion blur.
Several works have tried to work around these limitations. Niemeyer
et al. [2024] first train a Zip-NeRF [Barron et al. 2023] that can model
distorted and rolling shutter cameras and then render perfect pin-
hole cameras from the neural field and distill them into a 3DGS
representation. This allows for fast inference, but is still limited
to perfect pinhole cameras. To address secondary lighting effects,
recent works bake occlusion information into spherical harmonics
at each Gaussian [Gao et al. 2023; Liang et al. 2023] or leverage
shading models and environment maps [Jiang et al. 2024]. The latter
two of these render only with rasterization; in contrast Gao et al.
[2023] traces rays for initial visibility determination, but uses only a
visibilty forward pass, and restricts ray tracing to the training phase,
relying on rasterization during inference and inheriting its limita-
tions. In contrast, our method uses optimized ray-tracing as the
sole renderer throughout both training and inference, which allows
for inserting objects, refraction, lens distortion, and other complex
effects. Additionally, Gao et al. [2023] use axis-aligned bounding
boxes (AABBs) to enclose particles, which results in approximately
3√ó lower FPS during inference compared to the stretched icosahe-
drons employed in our optimized tracer (Section 5.2). Finally, for
complex lens effects, Seiskari et al. [2024] model the motion blur and
rolling shutter of the camera by approximating them in screen space
through rasterization with pixel velocities. Unlike these works, we
formulate a principled method for efficient ray tracing of volumetric
particles, which natively alleviates all the limitations mentioned
above and further allows us to simulate effects such as depth of field
and perfect mirrors.

2.3 Differentiable Ray Tracing of Volumetric Particles
Ray tracing became the gold standard for offline rendering of high-
quality photo-realistic images [Whitted 1979]. The advent of dedi-
cated hardware to efficiently compute the intersection of camera

232:4

rays with the scene geometry has also enabled its use for real-time
rendering applications such as gaming and the simulation industry.
Modern GPUs are exposing ray tracing rendering pipelines, from
the computation of dedicated acceleration structures to a specific
programmable interface [Joshi et al. 2007].

However, these works are highly optimized for rendering opaque
surfaces and efficiently handling order independent semi-transparent
surfaces or particles remains challenging [‚ÄúTanki‚Äù Zhang 2021].

A first class of works [Aizenshtein et al. 2022; M√ºnstermann et al.
2018] proposes to first estimate the transmittance function along
the ray and subsequently to integrate the particles‚Äô radiance based
on this estimate. It assumes the traversal of the full scene to be fast
enough; an assumption that does not hold in Gaussian particles for
scene reconstruction.

A second class of works consists in re-ordering the particles along
the ray. Knoll et al. [2019] propose a slab-tracing method to trace
semi-transparent volumetric RBF (radial basis function) particles,
which enables real-time ray tracing of scenes consisting of several
millions of such particles. However, its efficiency is largely based
on the assumption of the isotropic shape of the particles and a high
level of uniformity in their spatial distribution. In [Br√ºll and Grosch
2020], the multi-layer alpha blending approach from [Salvi and
Vaidyanathan 2014] is extended to ray tracing. Their multi-layer
alpha tracing supports efficient rendering of any semi-transparent
surface but its approximation of the particle‚Äôs ordering may produce
rendering artifacts.

Our formulation takes root in these precursory works. However
as opposed to [Knoll et al. 2019], it is guaranteed to process every
particle intersecting the ray, and contrary to [Br√ºll and Grosch 2020]
the hit processing order is consistent, which ensures the differentia-
bility of our tracing algorithm.

Compared to rasterization, differentiable ray tracing of semi-
transparent particles has seen much less progress in recent years.
Perhaps the most similar rendering formulation to ours was pro-
posed in Fuzzy Metaballs [Keselman and Hebert 2022, 2023], but it
is limited to scenes with a small set of 3D Gaussian particles (several
tens) and images with very low resolution. Different to Fuzzy Meta-
balls, our method can easily handle scenes with several millions
of particles from which it can render full HD images in real-time.
In another direction, Belcour et al. [2013] incorporate defocus and
motion blur in to ray tracers by leveraging Gaussian approximations
as a sampling technique, rather than a scene representation as used
here.

3 BACKGROUND
We begin with a short review of 3D Gaussian scene representation,
volumetric particle rendering, and hardware-accelerated ray tracing.

3D Gaussian Parameterization

3.1
Extending Kerbl et al. [2023], our scenes can be represented as a set
of differentiable semi-transparent particles defined by their kernel
function. For example, the kernel function of a 3D Gaussian particle
ùúå : R3 ‚Üí R at a given point ùíô ‚àà R3 can be expressed as

ùúå (ùíô) = ùëí ‚àí (ùíô ‚àíùùÅ )ùëá ùö∫‚àí1 (ùíô ‚àíùùÅ ),

(1)

where ùùÅ ‚àà R3 represents the particle‚Äôs position and ùö∫ ‚àà R3√ó3 the
covariance matrix. To ensure the positive semi-definiteness of the
covariance matrix ùö∫ when optimizing it using gradient descent, we
represent it as

ùëá

ùëá
ùëπ

ùö∫ = ùëπùë∫ùë∫

(2)
with ùëπ ‚àà SO(3) a rotation matrix and ùë∫ ‚àà R3√ó3 a scaling matrix.
These are both stored as their equivalent vector representations,
a quaternion ùíí ‚àà R4 for the rotation and a vector ùíî ‚àà R3 for the
scale. For other particle variants explored in this work, please refer
to Section 4.5.

Each particle is further associated with an opacity coefficient
ùúé ‚àà R, and a parametric radiance function ùúôùú∑ (ùíÖ) : R3 ‚Üí R3,
dependent on the view direction ùíÖ ‚àà R3. In practice, following
Kerbl et al. [2023], we use a spherical harmonics functions ùëåùëö
(ùíÖ)
‚Ñì
of order ùëö = 3 defined by the coefficients ùú∑ ‚àà R48. Note that we
are using the ray direction while Kerbl et al. [2023] uses ùùÅ ‚àíùíê
for
‚à•ùùÅ ‚àíùíê ‚à•

Therefore the parametric radiance function can be written as

where ùëì is the sigmoid function to normalize the colors.

3.2 Differentiable Rendering of Particle Representations
Given this parametrization, the scene can be rendered along a ray
ùíì (ùúè) = ùíê + ùúèùíÖ with origin ùíê ‚àà R3 and direction ùíÖ ‚àà R3 via classical

where ùíÑùëñ (ùíÖ) = ùúôùú∑ùëñ (ùíÖ) is the color of the ùëñth Gaussian obtained by
evaluating its view-dependant radiance function. The transmittance
function ùëá (ùíê, ùíÖ) is defined as

(cid:16)(cid:205)ùëñ (1 ‚àí ùëí ‚àíùúéùëñ ùúåùëñ (ùíê+ùúèùíÖ ) )ùíÑùëñ (ùíÖ)

Considering ùõºùëñ = ùúéùëñ ùúåùëñ (xùëñ ), Equation 4 can be approximated using

where in this linear approximation, xùëñ is defined as the point along
the ray ùíì with the highest response ùúåùëñ of the ùëñth Gaussian (see 4.3 for
more details). For derivations of the higher order approximations of
ùúåùëñ please refer to [Keselman and Hebert 2022].

3.3 Hardware-Accelerated Ray Tracing
In this work we use NVIDIA RTX hardware through the NVIDIA
OptiX programming interface [Parker et al. 2010]. Through this in-
terface, geometric primitives such as triangle meshes are processed
to construct a Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH1). This acceleration

1For clarity, throughout this work we reference BVH as the de-facto hardware accel-
eration structure. However, since in practice NVIDIA OptiX‚Äôs specification interfaces
the implementation of bottom level acceleration structures, we emphasize our pipeline
does not depend on a particular implementation.

Fig. 3. Overview of the Accelerated Tracing Algorithm: Given a set of 3D particles, we first build the corresponding bounding primitives and insert them
into a BVH. To compute the incoming radiance along each ray, we trace rays against the BVH to get the next k particles. We then compute the intersected
particles‚Äô response and accumulate the radiance according to Equation 6. The process repeats until all particles have been evaluated or the transmittance
meets a predefined threshold and the final rendering is returned.

4 METHOD
The proposed volumetric particle tracer requires two core com-
ponents: a strategy to represent particles in an acceleration struc-
ture (BVH) to efficiently test for intersections against them, using
adaptive bounding mesh primitives (Section 4.1), and a rendering
algorithm which casts rays and gathers batches of intersections,
efficiently scheduled onto the NVIDIA OptiX tracing model (Sec-
tion 4.2).

4.1 Bounding Primitives
Any ray-tracer must somehow insert the primitive particles into
a BVH and query the primitives intersected by a ray. The first
challenge is then to decide how to insert particles into a BVH and
conservatively test intersection against them.

The NVIDIA OptiX programming model supports three primi-
tive types which can be inserted into the BVH: triangles, spheres,
and custom primitives given by their axis-aligned bounding boxes
(AABBs). These options admit many possible strategies to build a
BVH over particles, such as constructing naive axis-aligned bounds
as AABBs or spheres, or building bounding triangle meshes. These
strategies have a tradeoff between the cost to test intersection vs. the
tightness of the bound. For instance, simply intersecting a ray with
the AABB around each particle is fast, but a diagonally-stretched
Gaussian particles will cause the traversal to have to evaluate many
false-positive intersections which actually contribute almost noth-
ing to the rendering. None of these strategies necessarily affect the
appearance of the rendered image, but rather the computation speed
and number of low-contribution particles needlessly processed. Bill-
board mesh proxies are used elsewhere [Niedermayr et al. 2023],
but do not apply in our general setting where rays may come from
any direction.

Stretched Polyhedron Proxy Geometry. After experimenting with
many variants (Section 5.2.1), we find it most effective to encapsulate
particles in a stretched regular icosahedron mesh (Figure 4), which
tightly bounds the particle and benefits from hardware-optimized
ray-triangle intersections. A hit against any front-facing triangle of
the bounding mesh triggers processing of the corresponding par-
ticle, as described later in Section 4.3. We fit the bounding proxy
by specifying a minimum response ùõºmin which must be captured
(typically ùõºmin = 0.01), and analytically compute an anisotropic
rescaling of the icosahedron to cover the whole space with at least

structure is optimized for the computation of ray-primitive inter-
sections by dedicated hardware, the RT cores. The programmable
pipeline sends traversal queries to this hardware, freeing the GPU
streaming-multiprocessors (SMs) for the main computational load,
e.g material shading. The interactions of the SMs with the RT cores
are done through the following programmable entry points:

‚Ä¢ ray-gen program (ray generation) is where the SMs may initi-

ate a scene traversal for a given ray.

‚Ä¢ intersection program is called during the traversal to compute
the precise intersection with potentially hit primitives that are
not directly supported by the hardware.

‚Ä¢ any-hit program is called during the traversal for every hit

and may further process or reject the hit.

‚Ä¢ closest-hit program is called at the end of the traversal, for

further processing of the closest accepted hit.

‚Ä¢ miss program is called at the end of the traversal for further

processing when no hit has been accepted.

Such a pipeline is highly optimized to render opaque primitives,
i.e. the number of expected hits during a traversal is low, with a
minimal amount of interactions between the SMs and the RT cores.
Rendering volumes, where the primitives are semi-transparent, re-
quires traversing and processing many hits per ray. To efficiently
trace a volume, specific approaches must be designed, tailored to
the type of primitives (or particles), their expected size, and distri-
bution across the volume (see for example [Knoll et al. 2019]). In
this work we propose an efficient and differentiable algorithm to
ray trace a volume made of optimized semi-transparent particles
for high-fidelity novel view rendering.

dron with a unit inner-sphere, and transform each canonical vertex

(7)

Importantly, this scaling incorporates the opacity of the particles, so
that large nearly-transparent particles may have smaller bounding
primitives, resulting in adaptive clamping of the particles.

4.2 Ray Tracing Renderer

Motivation. Given the ability to cast rays against particles, volu-
metric rendering as in Equation 6 requires accumulating the con-
tribution of particles along the ray in a sorted order. One naive ap-
proach within the NVIDIA OptiX programming model (Section 3.3)
is to repeatedly cast the ray, process the nearest particle with a
closest-hit program, then re-cast the ray to find the next particle.
Another is to traverse the scene only twice, once to estimate the
transmittance function, and once to the compute the integral as in
[M√ºnstermann et al. 2018]. Both of these strategies are prohibitively
expensive, due to the cost of traversing the scene.

Our renderer builds on past approaches for tracing semi-transparent

surfaces or particles: Knoll et al. [2019] repeated gather slabs of parti-
cles and sort within each slab, while Br√ºll and Grosch [2020] process
all semi-transparent surfaces into a ùëò-buffer, merging adjacent parti-
cles when the list overflows. As discussed in Section 2.3, because of
their approximations, these algorithms do not produce a consistent
rendering, which prevents differentiation and generates artifacts.

Algorithm. Figure 5, Figure 3, Procedure 1, and Procedure 2 sum-
marize our approach. To compute incoming radiance along each ray,
a ray-gen program traces a ray against the BVH to gather the next
ùëò particles, using an any-hit program to maintain a sorted buffer of
their indices. For efficiency, at this stage the particle response is not
yet evaluated; all primitive hits are treated as intersected particles.
The ray-gen program then iterates through the sorted array of prim-
itive hits, retrieves the corresponding particle for each, and renders
them according to Equation 6. The process then repeats, tracing a

new ray from the last rendered particle to gather the next ùëò particles.
The process terminates once all particles intersecting the ray are
processed, or early-terminates as soon as enough particle density
is intersected to reach a predefined minimum transmittance ùëámin.
Compared to past approaches this renderer allows for processing
the intersection in a consistent order, without missing any particle
nor approximating the transmittance.

Nonetheless, this proposed algorithm is just one of many possible
variants, chosen for performance after extensive benchmarking.
See Section 5.2 for timings and ablations against a selection of
alternatives considered; we find that subtle changes to the algorithm
have a dramatic effect of speed and quality on densely-clustered
multi-view scenes.

4.3 Evaluating Particle Response
After identifying ray-particle inter-
sections, we must choose how to com-
pute the contribution of each particle
to the ray. As with prior work, we
take a single sample per particle, but
we still must choose at what distance
ùúè along the ray to evaluate that sam-
ple. Knoll et al. [2019] orthogonally project the center of the particle
on to the ray; this strategy is reasonable for isotropic particles,
but can lead to significant error for stretched anisotropic parti-
cles. Instead, we analytically compute a sample location ùúèmax =
argmaxùúè ùúå (ùíê + ùúèùíÖ), the point of maximum response from the parti-
cle along the ray. For Gaussian particles, this becomes

ùúèmax =

(ùùÅ ‚àí ùíê)ùëá ùö∫‚àí1
ùíÖùëá ùö∫‚àí1
ùíÖ

ùëπùëá (ùíê ‚àí ùùÅ) and ùíÖùëî = ùë∫ ‚àí1

ùëπùëá ùíÖ.

Note that this strategy incurs a slight approximation in the or-
dering: the particle hits are integrated in the order of the bounding
primitive intersections instead of the order of the sample locations.
However, we empirically confirmed that this approximation does
not lead to any substantial loss in the quality of the end result.

4.4 Differentiable Ray Tracing and Optimization

Differentiable Rendering. Beyond forward-rendering of particle
scenes, our ray tracing renderer is also differentiable, to support
optimizing particle scenes from observed data. To backpropagate
(i.e., reverse-mode differentiate) through the renderer with respect
to particle parameters, we first perform an ordinary forward-pass
render and compute the desired objective functions. Then, in the
backward pass we re-cast the same rays to sample the same set of
particles in order, computing gradients with respect to each shading
expression and accumulating gradients in shared buffers with atomic
scatter-add operations. We implemented all derivative expressions
by hand in an NVIDIA OptiX ray-gen program which is structurally
similar to Procedure 1.

Optimization. To fit particle scenes using our ray tracer, we adopt
the optimization scheme of Kerbl et al. [2023], including pruning,
cloning and splitting operations. One significant change is needed:
Kerbl et al. [2023] track screen-space gradients of particle positions
as a criteria for cloning and splitting, but in our more-general setting,
screen space gradients are neither available nor meaningful‚Äîinstead,
we use gradients in 3D world-space for the same purpose. Recent
work has proposed many promising extensions to the optimization
scheme of Kerbl et al. [2023]. While our ray tracer is generally
compatible with any of these extensions, we stay faithful to the
original approach for the sake of consistent comparisons. It should
also be noted that as particles are updated during optimization, the
ray tracing BVH must be regularly rebuilt (see Figure 9, bottom left
for BVH build time).

Fig. 6. Particle Kernel Functions: (a) In addition to 3D Gaussians, in this
work we investigated three other particle types: the generalized Gaussian
(GG2), kernelized surface (SGG2) and cosine wave modulation (CSGG2)
particles. (b) Shows radiance and normal reconstructions obtained with the
kernelized surface particles for two scenes.

Training with Incoherent Rays. Optimization in computer vision
often benefits from stochastic descent, fitting to randomly-sampled
subsets of a problem on each iteration. However, differentiable ras-
terization can only efficiently render whole images or tiles, and thus
efficient stochastic optimization over the set of pixels in a scene is
not possible. In our ray tracer, we are free to train with stochastically-
sampled rays, drawn at random or according to some importance
sampling during training, see Section 5.1. Note that when stochastic
sampling is used, window-based image objectives such as SSIM
cannot be used.

4.5 Particle Kernel Functions
Our formulation does not require the particles to have a Gauss-
ian kernel, enabling the exploration of other particle variants. We
consider a general particle defined by its kernel function ÀÜùúå (ùíô). In ad-
dition to the standard Gaussian, we investigate three other variants,
visualized in Figure 6:

ÀÜùúå (ùíô) = ùúéùëí ‚àí (ùíô ‚àíùùÅ )ùëá ùö∫‚àí1 (ùíô ‚àíùùÅ ),

‚Ä¢ Generalized Gaussians of degree ùëõ (we use ùëõ = 2):

ÀÜùúåùëõ (ùíô) = ùúéùëí ‚àí ( (ùíô ‚àíùùÅ )ùëá ùö∫‚àí1 (ùíô ‚àíùùÅ ) )ùëõ

with ùúì an optimizable parameter.

Comparative evaluations with these particles are presented in Ta-
ble 4. The generalized Gaussian kernel function defines denser par-
ticles, reducing the number of intersections and increasing the per-
formance by a factor of 2 compared to standard Gaussians, see
Section 5.2.3 for more discussion. The kernelized surface variant
defines flat particles with well-defined normals, which can be en-
capsulated by a two triangle primitive (Section 4.1) well-adapted to
our tracing model. Finally, the modulation by a cosine wave aims to
model a particle with spatially varying radiance.

5 EXPERIMENTS AND ABLATIONS
In this section we evaluate the proposed approach on several stan-
dard benchmark datasets for quality and speed, and perform ablation
studies on key design choices in Section 5.2. Additional details on
experiments and implementation can be found in the appendix.

Method Variants. In the experiments that follow, we will refer
to two variants of our method. The Ours (reference) variant corre-
sponds to [Kerbl et al. 2023] as closely as possible. It employs regular
3D Gaussian particles, and leaves the optimization hyperparameters
unchanged. We treat this as a high-quality configuration. The Ours
variant is adapted based on the experiments that follow, improving
runtime speed at a slight expense of quality. It uses degree-2 gen-
eralized Gaussian particles, a density learning rate to 0.09 during
optimizing, as well as optimizing with incoherent rays in a batch
size of 219 starting after 15,000 training iterations. Empirically, we
find that the larger density learning rate of this model produces
denser particles. When combined with the faster fall-off of degree-2
generalized Gaussian particles compared to regular Gaussians, this
leads to fewer hits along the rays and faster rendering speeds with
minimal quality loss.

5.1 Novel View Synthesis Benchmarks

Baselines. There is a significant amount of recent and ongoing
research on scene representation. We include comparisons to several
representative well-known methods, including 3DGS [Kerbl et al.
2023], INGP [M√ºller et al. 2022], and MipNeRF360 [Barron et al.
2022], as a standard for comparison. The latter two are widely-
used ray-marching methods that, like this work, do not have the
limitations of rasterization. We additionally compare with the non-
neural method of Plenoxels [Sara Fridovich-Keil and Alex Yu et al.
2022].

Evaluation Metrics. We evaluate the perceptual quality of the
novel-views in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), learned
perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS), and structural similarity
(SSIM) metrics. To evaluate the efficiency, we measure GPU time re-
quired for rendering a single image without the overhead of storing
the data to a hard drive or visualizing them in a GUI. Specifically,
we report the performance numbers in terms of frames-per-second
measured on a single NVIDIA RTX 6000 Ada. For all evaluations,
we use the dataset-recommended resolution for evaluation.

5.1.1 MipNeRF360. MipNeRF360 [Barron et al. 2022] is a challeng-
ing dataset consisting of large scale outdoor and indoor scenes. In

our evaluation, we use the four indoor (room, counter, kitchen,
bonsai) and three outdoor (bicycle, garden, stump) scenes with-
out licensing issues. In line with prior work, we used images down-
sampled by a factor two for the indoor and a factor four for the
outdoor scenes in all our evaluations.

Table 1 shows quantitative results, while novel-views are qual-
itatively compared in Figure 7. In terms of quality, our method
performs on par or slightly better than 3DGS [Kerbl et al. 2023] and
other state-of-the-art methods. For this dataset, we also compare
our method against the recent top-tier method of Zip-NeRF [Barron
et al. 2023] which achieves 30.38 PSNR. In terms of runtime (Table 2),
at 78 FPS our efficient ray tracing implementation is approximately
three times slower than rasterization (238 FPS), while maintaining
interactive speeds compared to high-quality ray-marching based
works MipNeRF360 and Zip-NeRF (<1 FPS). Zip-NeRF employs
multisampling to approximate conical frustums in the ray-casting
process, combining MipNeRF360‚Äôs anti-aliasing techniques with
the speedup mechanism of INGP. While achieving unprecedented
rendering quality, Zip-NeRF does not support real-time rendering
(< 1 FPS).

5.1.2 Tanks & Temples. Tanks & Temples dataset contains two
large outdoor scenes (Truck and Train) with a prominent object in
the center, around which the camera is rotating. These scenes are
particularly challenging due to the illumination differences between
individual frames as well as the presence of dynamic objects.

Similar to the results on MipNeRF360 dataset, our method again
performs on par with the state-of-the-art methods in terms of quality,
while the speed is approximately 1.7 times slower than 3DGS at 190
FPS. Qualitative results are depicted in Figure 7. On this dataset,
Ours achieves better PSNR than our Ours (reference), but is still
worse in terms of LPIPS and SSIM. We hypothesize that this is due
to the lack of SSIM loss supervision when training the model with
incoherent rays.

5.1.3 Deep Blending. Following Kerbl et al. [2023], we use two
indoor scenes Playroom and DrJohnson from the Deep Blending
dataset. Table 1 shows that our reference implementation Ours
(reference) outperforms all baselines across all qualitative metrics.
Different to other datasets, we observe a larger quality drop of Ours.
This is a result of a quality drop on Playroom where we observed in-
stability of the training with incoherent rays. We leave more detailed
investigation and parameter tuning of incoherent rays training for
future work.

5.1.4 NeRF Synthetic. NeRF Synthetic is a commonly used syn-
thetic object-centring dataset introduced by Mildenhall et al. [2020].
The eight scenes with synthetic objects were rendered in Blender
and display strong view-dependent effects and intricate geometry
structures. See Table 5 in the appendix for a per-scene breakdown.
Both versions of our method outperform all the baselines in terms
of PSNR. In fact, Ours outperforms Ours (reference) on seven out of
eight scenes. We conjecture this is due to the simplicity of scenes
which are well represented with less hits, and the positive contribu-
tion of training with incoherent rays. On these simpler scenes with
lower resolution images, our method is capable of rendering novel
views at 450FPS and is only 50% slower than 3DGS.

5.1.5 Zip-NeRF and Distortion. The rasterization approach in 3DGS
[Kerbl et al. 2023] implicitly treats supervision images as coming
from perfect-pinhole cameras, whereas our ray-tracing approach
can easily be applied directly to highly-distorted cameras such as
fisheye captures. Images can be undistorted through postprocessing
to enable fitting with 3DGS, but this comes at a cost, including
significant cropping or wasted space in the image plane.

We demonstrate this effect on the Zip-NeRF dataset [Barron et al.
2023], which includes four large-scale scenes featuring both indoor
and outdoor areas. These scenes are originally captured from highly
distorted fisheye cameras, with undistorted versions also provided
through postprocessing. Table 3 and Figure 8 compare the quality of
training 3DGS on undistorted views, vs. our ray-traced method on
the undistorted views or the original distorted images. Our model
achieves the highest quality when trained on the original distorted
images, partly due to the loss of input supervision signals caused
by the cropping of marginal pixels during undistortion. Note that
rendering 3DGS from the original fisheye views is impossible, as its
tile-based rasterizer is designed for perfect-pinhole rendering.

5.2 Ray Tracing Analysis and Ablations
We evaluate the performance of the proposed ray tracer and com-
pare to alternatives. Experiments are evaluated on the union of all
validation datasets from Section 5.1. We measure forward rendering
time, which we observed to correlate closely with the per-iteration
time for the backward pass.

5.2.1 Particle Primitives. We first consider different bounding prim-
itive strategies as discussed in Section 4.1. The primitives evaluated
are:

‚Ä¢ Custom primitive AABBs: bounding box primitive, see Fig-

ure 4 left.

‚Ä¢ Octahedron: an eight-faced regular polyhedron mesh.
‚Ä¢ Icosahedron: a twenty-faced regular polyhedron mesh.
‚Ä¢ Icosahedron + unclamped: icosahedron without adaptive

clamping.

et al. 2023] when trained and tested on distorted or undistorted views.

Scales are determined as in Equation 7, except the unclamped variant
which omits the opacity term in that expression.

Figure 9 (bottom-left) shows the time to build a BVH relative
to the number of particles for the different primitives. For simple
AABBs, the build time is almost constant whereas for the more
complex icosahedron based primitives, the build time is close to
linear with more than 30ms per millions of particles. The same figure
also gives the framerate vs. the number of particles for different
primitives. First, the number of particles does not strictly determine
the performance. Second, more complex primitives with tighter
bounding envelopes yield higher framerates, and adaptive clamping
based on opacity has a large positive effect.

5.2.2 Tracing Algorithms. We consider several alternatives of the
proposed ray tracer from Section 4.2, both comparisons to prior
work and variants of our method. The evaluated approaches are:

‚Ä¢ Naive closest-hit tracing: repeated closest-hit ray-tracing to

traverse every particle hitting the ray in depth order.

‚Ä¢ Slab tracing [Knoll et al. 2019] (SLAB): tracing slabs along
the ray, order independent collection of the ùëò-first hits in the
any-hit program, sorting and integrating the hits in the ray-gen
program.

‚Ä¢ Multi-layer alpha tracing [Br√ºll and Grosch 2020] (MLAT):
tracing a single ray with in depth order collection of the hits
and merging the closest hits when the ùëò buffer is full in the
any-hit program.

‚Ä¢ Our proposed method: tracing a dynamic number of rays
with in-order collection of the hits, stopping to evaluate con-
tributions when the ùëò buffer is full in the any-hit program.
‚Ä¢ Ours + tiled tracing: tracing one ray per ùëÅ √ó ùëÅ tile, but still
evaluating appearance per pixel, akin to tile-based rasteriza-
tion.

‚Ä¢ Ours + stochastic depth sampling: tracing a single ray
with in depth order collection of the ùëò first accepted sam-
ples. Samples are accepted based on the importance sampling
ùëû(ùíô) = ÀÜùúå (ùíô).

For each algorithm with a choice of parameters (size of the array,
number of slabs, or number of samples), we perform a parameter
sweep and present the best-performing setting.

The performance relative to the accuracy of these implementa-
tions are shown in the top-left of Figure 9. Naive closest-hit tracing
is almost twice as slow as our method, due to over-traversal of the
BVH. Slab tracing and multi-layer alpha tracing are designed to
minimize over-traversal and hence achieve much better runtime
performance, but this speed comes from approximate image forma-
tion (ordering approximation for MLAT, under-sampling particles
for SLAB), and the accuracy of these methods is substantially lower.

of the different primitives on both the BVH building time and the FPS.
Bottom right: Mean number of hits vs. mean FPS for every sequence of our

In the differentiable setting, we find that these these approxima-
tions make those methods unusable for optimizing scenes. Adding
tile-based rendering to our approach yields a promising speedup, at
the cost of a small approximation. We do not see immediate benefit
from stochastic depth sampling, because most of the computation
has to be done in the any-hit program, preventing a good balance
of the tracing workload.

5.2.3 Particle Kernel Function. In Section 4.5 we consider particle
kernel functions beyond Gaussians. Table 4 gives results; notably
generalized Gaussians with ùëõ = 2 significantly increase ray tracing
speed at only a small cost of quality.

Figure 9 (bottom-right) shows the mean-hits number versus the
performance for the Gaussian kernel and the generalized Gaussian
kernel of degree 2. It reaffirms that the performance depends on the

per-ray particles hits for the Gaussian (left) and for the generalized Gaussian
kernel function of degree 2 (right) (‚Ä¢ represents no hits).

number of hits rather than the number of particles, as noted previ-
ously. This explains the source of the speedup for the generalized
Gaussian kernel, as the sharper extent reduces the number of hits.
See Figure 10 for a visual plot.

5.2.4 Hit Buffer Size. Figure 9 (top-right) measures the effect of
the particle buffer size ùëò, which determines how many particle hits
are gathered during each raycast before stopping to evaluate their
response. False rejected hits are hits which are traversed, but not
collected into the buffer because it is full with closer hits; these hits
often must be re-traversed later. False accepted hits are hits which are
gathered into the buffer, but ultimately do not contribute to radiance
because the transmittance threshold is already met. Both of these
false hits harm performance, and choosing the particle batch size is
a tradeoff between them. We find ùëò = 16 to offer a good compromise

meshes; if a mesh is hit, we render all particles only up to the hit, and
then compute a response based on the material. For refractions and
reflections, this means continuing tracing along a new redirected
ray according to the laws of optics. For non-transparent diffused
meshes, we compute the color and blend it with the current ray
radiance, then terminate the ray.

Depth of Field. Following [M√ºller et al. 2022], we simulate depth
of field by progressively tracing multiple independent ray samples
per pixel (spp), weighted together with a moving average to denoise
the output image. The examples in Figures 2 and 13 use 64-256
spp, although convergence is often reached with fewer samples by
selecting subsamples with low discrepancy sequences [Burley 2020].

Artificial Shadows. Even in radiance field scenes with baked-in
lighting, simple shadow effects can be emulated by casting a ray
towards a point or mesh emitter, and artificially darkening the
contribution from that point if the light is not visible. We adopt
this approach, casting shadow rays after computing the directional
contribution from each particle.

Instancing

6.2
In rendering, instancing is a technique to render multiple trans-
formed copies of an object with greatly reduced cost. Although
rendering libraries may support some form of instancing in the
context of rasterization, the technique is particularly effective for
ray tracing. This is because repeated copies of an object can be
stored as linked references in subtrees of the BVH, without actually
duplicating the geometry. This allows for scaling to 100s or 1000s of
instanced objects at little additional cost‚Äîthe same is not possible
with rasterization. Our efficient ray tracer enables particle scene
data to be instanced, as shown in Figure 14 where we crop an object
from a fitted scene and render 1024 copies of it at 25 FPS.

Fig. 12. Finetuning Pretrained 3DGS Models: After only 500 iterations
of finetuning, we can recover most of the perceptual quality of 3DGS [Kerbl
et al. 2023]. After 2k iterations we match or outperform 3DGS across all
datasets.

6 APPLICATIONS
Most importantly, efficient differentiable ray tracing enables new
applications and techniques to be applied to particle scene represen-
tations.

6.1 Ray-Based Effects
First, we the radiance field rendering pipeline with a variety of visual
effects which are naturally compatible with ray tracing (Figure 2
and 13). Here we demonstrate only manually-specified forward
rendering, although inverse rendering in concert with these effects
is indeed supported by our approach, and is a promising area for
ongoing work.

Reflections, Refractions and Inserted Meshes. Optical ray effects are
supported by interleaved tracing of triangular faces and Gaussian
particles. Precisely, we maintain an extra acceleration structure con-
sisting only of mesh faces for additional inserted geometry. When
casting each ray in Procedure 1, we first cast rays against inserted

as inputs like distorted fisheye lenses (left), which can be re-rendered using different camera models like regular perspective cameras (right), achieving high
reconstruction quality relative to unseen references (see insets (‚Ä¢) - this synthetic cozyroom scene is by [Ma et al. 2021]). (b) Ray tracing also naturally enables
compensating for time-dependent effects like rolling shutter imagine sensors, which induce distortions due to sensor motion. This effect is illustrated on the

By incorporating time-dependent per-pixel poses in the reconstruction, our method faithfully recuperates the true undistorted geometry (right).

6.3 Denoising and Stochastic Sampling
In ray tracing more broadly, research on stochastic integration tech-
niques is key to highly sample-efficient yet perceptually compelling
renders. As a small demonstration, we show how our approach can
be combined with stochastic sampling and denoising.

As discussed in Section 5.2.2, our approach may be extended to
stochastic-sampling by rejecting the hits received in the any-hit
program based on the importance sampling distribution ùëû = ÀÜùúå (ùíô).
Since traversal stops as soon as the ùëò-closest accepted samples are
collected, this modification noticeably improves performance (see
Figure 9 top-left). This performance comes at a quality cost, but
as shown in Figure 15, the resulting noise has statistics that an
off-the-shelf denoiser can easily remove.

6.4 Complex Cameras and Autonomous Vehicle Scenes
Ray tracing makes it easy, efficient, and accurate to render from
exotic cameras which are far from ideal pinholes, such as highly-
distorted fisheye cameras and those with rolling shutter effects
(Figure 16). While optical distortions for low-FOV lenses can be
tackled to some extent by image rectification, and rolling shutter
distortions can be approached by associating rasterized tiles to
row/columns with consistent timestamps, both workarounds can‚Äôt
be applied simultaneously, as image rectification distorts the sets of
concurrently measured pixels in a non-linear way. In ray tracing,
handling complex cameras simply means generating each ray with
source and direction which actually correspond to the underlying
camera, even if those rays may be incoherent and lack a shared
origin.

Autonomous Vehicles. The imaging systems used on autonomous
vehicle (AV) platforms and other robot systems often incorporate
such cameras, and it is very important to reconstruct and render
them accurately in those applications. Figure 17, gives an example
of an autonomous driving scene reconstructed from a side-mounted
camera, which exhibits both apparent intrinsic camera and rolling
shutter distortion effects.

To further highlight the importance of accurately handling these
effects, we perform a quantitative evaluation of our method against

tions often have to respect both distorted intrinsic camera models and are,
at the same time, affected by time-dependent effects like rolling shutter
distortions as frames are exposed at high sensor speeds. Our ray tracing-
based reconstruction is well-suited to handle both challenges simultaneously,
which we illustrated by an example of a side-facing top-to-bottom rolling
shutter camera on an AV vehicle: the top inset (‚Ä¢) depicts faithful removal
of the intrinsic camera model distortion by rendering with an undistorted
camera, while the bottom inset (‚Ä¢) shows our ability to remove the apparent
rolling-shutter distortions of the inputs by rendering from a static camera

its rasterization equivalent 3DGS [Kerbl et al. 2023] on autonomous
driving scenes. We select 9 scenes from the Waymo Open Perception
dataset [Sun et al. 2020] with no dynamic objects to ensure accurate
reconstructions. Both methods are trained with the images captured
by the camera mounted on the front of the vehicle to reconstruct
the scene. We make several changes to the training protocol to
adapt it to this data, including incorporating lidar depth, see the
appendix for details. For the case of 3DGS, we rectify the images and
ignore the rolling shutter effects, while with our tracing algorithm
we can make use of the full camera model and compensate for
the rolling shutter effect (see Figure 17). Ray tracing achieves a
rectified PSNR of 29.99 on this benchmark, compared to 29.83 for
ordinary 3DGS‚Äîthe improvement is modest, but it corresponds to
correctly reconstructing important geometries, such as the signpost
in Figure 17.

7 DISCUSSION
7.1 Differences Between Ray Tracing and Rasterization
Here, we recap key differences between our ray tracer and the
Gaussian splatting rasterizer proposed by Kerbl et al. [2023].

Generality. Splat rasterization accelerates rendering by process-
ing a screen grid of pixel rays emanating from a single viewpoint in
16ùë•16 tiles, whereas ray tracing uses a BVH and can render along
arbitrary distributions of rays from any direction.

Primary vs. General Rays. As in graphics more broadly, ray tracing
has significant benefits over rasterization to model general lighting
and image formation. In this work, we demonstrate a variety of
effects such as reflection, refraction, depth of field, and artificial
shadows enabled by ray tracing (Section 6.1). In addition, we note
that differentiable ray tracing opens the door to further research on
global illumination, inverse lighting, and physical BSDFs.

Complex Cameras. Using per-pixel rays, ray tracing can easily
model more general image formation processes that exhibit non-
linear optical models such as highly-distorted and high-FOV fisheye
lenses, as well as time-dependent effects like rolling shutter dis-
tortions, which originate from rows/columns exposed at different
timestamps (cf. [Li et al. 2024b]). These are important for robotics
(Section 6.4), yet difficult or impossible to model with tile-based
rasterization.

Speed. For forward rendering, our approach achieves real-time
performance, and is only about 2√ó slower than 3DGS‚Äôs tiled raster-
ization in the basic case of rendering primary rays from pinhole
cameras (see Table 2). For differentiable rendering to fit scenes, our
ray tracing approach is 2√ó-5√ó slower than rasterization, mainly due
to the need to rebuild the BVH (Section 4.4), and additional arith-
metic needed to evaluate the backward pass as terms are no longer
shared between pixels. As an example, for the Tanks & Temples‚Äôs
Truck scene, ray tracing is 3.3√ó slower per iteration of optimiza-
tion, with a mean iteration time of 100ms (30ms spent on the BVH
construction, 15ms on the forward pass and 30ms on the backward
pass), while the rasterization requires 30ms per-iteration (7ms on
the forward pass and 10ms on the backward pass). Furthermore,
our approach enables training with incoherent rays as discussed in
Section 4.4, but in that case ray incoherency further increases the
cost of ray tracing, leading to 5√ó slower optimization.

Sub-Pixel Behavior. Splat rasterization implicitly applies a pixel-
scale convolution to Gaussians [Zwicker et al. 2001], whereas our
ray tracer truly point-samples the rendering function and has no
such automatic antialiasing. This may lead to differences of ren-
dered appearance for subpixel-skinny Gaussian particles. However,
point-sampled rendering is well-suited to modern denoisers (see Sec-
tion 6.3).

Interoperability. It is possible to directly render scenes trained
with the rasterizer under the ray tracing renderer, however due to
subtle differences noted above, there will be a noticeable drop in
quality when directly switching between renderers. This can be
quickly remedied with fine-tuning (see Figure 12).

3D Gaussian Ray Tracing: Fast Tracing of Particle Scenes

‚Ä¢

232:15

Approximations. Rasterization makes an approximation by eval-
uating directional appearance through the spherical harmonics ùú∑
from a single ray direction, meaning each particle has constant ap-
pearance direction in all pixels of an image. To support arbitrary
distributions of rays in our ray tracer, each particle is evaluated
exactly with the appropriate incoming ray direction. Additionally,
rasterization approximates depth ordering in 16x16 tiles.

7.2 Limitations and Future Work
Our ray tracer is carefully designed to make use of hardware acceler-
ation and offers significant speedup over baseline implementations
(Figure 9), however ray tracing is still slower than rasterization
when rendering from a pinhole camera. Additionally, the need to
regularly rebuild the BVH during training incurs additional cost and
adds overhead to dynamic scenes. Nonetheless, our implementation
is still fast enough for training and interactive rendering, and more
importantly it opens the door to many new capabilities such as
distorted cameras and ray-based visual effects (Section 6). See Sec-
tion 7.1 for an in-depth discussion of the trade-offs of rasterization
vs. ray tracing in this setting.

Looking forward, this work creates great potential for further
research on inverse rendering, relighting, and material decomposi-
tion on particle representations. Indeed, recent work in this direc-
tion [Gao et al. 2023; Liang et al. 2023], has relied on approximations
due to the lack of an efficient ray tracer. More broadly, there is
much promising research to be done unifying advances in scene
reconstruction from computer vision with the formulations for pho-
torealistic rendering from computer graphics.

B ADDITIONAL EXPERIMENTS AND ABLATIONS
Figure 18 shows qualitative comparisons of our method against
MIPNeRF360 [Barron et al. 2022]. The zoomed-in insets demonstrate
that both of our settings achieve comparable or better renderings
with sharp features. The first three rows contain scenes from the
MipNeRF360 dataset, while the last two rows feature scenes from
Tanks & Temples.

As mentioned in Section A, we propose a simple visibility prun-
ing strategy to prevent the number of particles from exceeding a
certain threshold. Table 6 presents an ablation study on the maxi-
mum number of allowed particles for scenes in two datasets: Tanks
& Temples and Deep Blending. When densification causes the
number of particles in the scene to exceed the threshold, we prune
the least visible particles based on their accumulated contribution
to the training views, reducing the number of particles to 90% of
the threshold. The results show that our visibility pruning strategy,
which filters out particles that contribute the least to the rendered
views, maintains quality even with as few as one million particles.

A IMPLEMENTATION AND TRAINING DETAILS
We wrap the NVIDIA OptiX tracer as a Pytorch extension and train
our representation using Adam optimizer for 30,000 iterations. We
set the learning rates for rotations, scales, and zeroth-order spherical
harmonics to 0.001, 0.005, and 0.0025, respectively. The learning
rate for the remaining spherical harmonics coefficients is 20 times
smaller than for the zeroth-order coefficient. Finally, we set the
density learning rate to either 0.05 for high-quality settings or 0.09
for fast-inference settings.

After initial 500 iterations, we start the densification and pruning
process, which we perform until 15,000 iterations are reached. To
densify the particles, we accumulate 3D positional gradients, scaled
by half the distance of each particle to the camera, to prevent under-
densification in distant regions. In line with 3DGS [Kerbl et al. 2023],
we split the particles if their maximum scale is above 1% of the scene
extent and clone them otherwise. Pruning directly removes particles
whose opacity is below 0.01. Additionally, we employ a simple
heuristic to cap the maximum number of particles to 3,000,000. We
denote this pruning strategy as visibility pruning. Specifically, if the
densification step results in more particles, we reduce their number
to 2,700,000 by pruning particles with minimum accumulated weight
contribution on the training views. Moreover, while densification
and pruning are in effect and similar to 3DGS, we reset the particle
densities to 0.01 every 3000 iterations. During training, we perform
early stopping to terminate the tracing of rays whose accumulated
transmittance falls below 0.001. During inference, we increase this
threshold to 0.03 for improved efficiency. We begin by solely training
the constant spherical harmonic and progressively increase the
spherical harmonics‚Äô degree every 1000 iterations, up to a maximum
of 3. We update the BVH every iteration and reconstruct it after
each pruning and densification.

For experiments with random-rays, during the last 15,000 itera-
tions, we sample random rays across all training views with a batch
size of 219 = 524,288, and only use the ùêø1 loss to supervise the
particles.

A.1 Autonomous Vehicles
To fit autonomous vehicle scenes, we modify our training protocol,
including incorporating lidar and depth supervision. To initialize,
we randomly sample 1 million lidar points visible in at least one
training image. These points are assigned an initial color via lookup
projected into a training image, and assigned an initial scale based
on the distance to the closest recorded camera pose. During training,
we use lidar to supervise depth; in our ray tracer depth is computed
by integrating the distance along the ray to each sample as if it were
radiance. Note that in 3DGS, lidar depth must be approximated by
projecting lidar rays onto camera images, yet in ray tracing lidar
rays can be directly cast into the scene. Additionally, we reconstruct
the sky following [Rematas et al. 2022] and employ a directional
MLP which predicts the color of the sky based on the ray direction.
A sky segmentation is included as input, and used to supervise ray
opacities computed from the particle scene.
